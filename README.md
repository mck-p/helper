# Helper

## Goal

The goal of Helper is to ensure that I am able to be the Hands and Feet of God
and to help others do the same.

## Development

We have split the Client and the API. The Client is responsible for serving the
Server-Side rendered Markup, along with handling any HTTP requests that the Browser
makes, such as Form Submitions (_Functions_) or dynamic pages (_Pages_). The API
is responsible for understanding and serving the Data Layer (_PSQL_) and for handling
any authorization needed.

### K8s/Docker

You can develop using K8s/Docker locally via [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)
and [K9s](https://k9scli.io/).

#### 1. Start Minikube

```sh
minikube start --addons=ingress,metrics-server --cpus=max
```

![Expected Output](./artifacts/Screenshot from 2022-08-27 10.45.20.png)


#### 2. Connect via K9s

```sh
k9s
```
![Expected Output](./artifacts/Screenshot%20from%202022-08-27%2010.46.26.png)

#### 3. Connect Minikube to Local Docker Commands

This will make all docker commands _typed in the shell session_ to be able
to be reached by Minikube. Specifically, this will allow you to run
`docker build` and `docker tag` commands and then have Minikube "pull" the
Images from that output. 

Do this in a shell that you will have open _forever_ and that you don't mind
running any docker commands on

```sh
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

#### 4. Build and Tag Images

```sh
# build client and tag it mckp/helper-client
# using the file Client.Dockerfile
# and using the context of this current directory
docker build -t mckp/helper-client -f Client.Dockerfile .
# You can also run
# ./scripts/build-client

# build api and tag it mckp/helper-api
# using the file API.Dockerfile
# and using the context of this current directory
docker build -t mckp/helper-api -f API.Dockerfile . 
# You can also run
# ./scripts/build-api

# You can build thema ll via
./scripts/build-services
```

#### 5. Apply K8s

```sh
kubectl apply -k ./k8s
```

Should cause pods to be created in your Minikube cluster

#### Install Dependencies

```sh
cd client && yarn
cd ../
cd api && yarn
cd ../
```

#### Start Backing Services

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

#### Connect to Local PSQL Instance

```sh
# Get the container ID
docker ps

# Enter the container
docker exec -it <container-id> bash

# run psql to connect using username and database name
psql -U username helper
```

#### Start Services

```sh
# In one terminal
cd client && yarn dev

# In another terminal
cd api && yarn dev
```
