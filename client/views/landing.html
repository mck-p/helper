    <h2>What is Helper?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Helper</strong> is a different type of social network: one built around you helping
      others. Be it your friends, family, church, or neighborhood, there are people in your communities
      that need you and your skills <em>today</em> and <strong>Helper</strong> wants to help you ensure
      that you are able to help them when and where you can.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Built around the concept that we are better together, <strong>Helper</strong> is designed to
      encourage action over "thoughts and prayers", to build up others instead of ourselves, to
      use our technologies and freedoms to leave our world better than we came into it. We are building
      <strong>Helper</strong> because we believe that our Groups are more important than us as
      individuals and want to help others find out how they can be helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it's knowing that your neighbor needs their lawn mowed next week or a fundraiser for a recent
      widow, all over our communities there are people in great need that we believe is up to us to
      fulfill. <strong>Helper</strong> ensures that no one falls through your support network's cracks,
      that every need is fulfilled and everyone feels a common sense of community.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe that through God we can find purpose and through helping we can find God.

      can help <em>you</em> help others.

            <strong>Helper</strong> ensures that your group is getting the support it needs by bringing
            to light the people and needs that are already in your communities while giving each member
            the ability and autonomy to help however and whenever they can.

            Do the people that know how to woodwork know that Sally needs a new deck? Do the prayer leaders
            know that Joe is in need of supernatural healing? <strong>Helper</strong> ensures that all of
            the needs of your groups are raised and assigned to a <strong>Helper</strong>, ensuring that 
            not only is each of us helping but that each of us is getting the help we need.

            <strong>Helper</strong> is being built by and for communities. From our Know Your Customer approach
            to joining a community to the communication tools used by communities, <strong>Helper</strong> is
            the one tool that evey community needs. Using cutting edge technologies, we hope that <strong>Helper</strong>
            will not only help us be helpful towards others but also help us <em>feel</em> a part of the communities we are in.

            The world we live in is predicated on selfishness.
            We want <strong>Helper</strong> to turn that inside out: to build a world where we
            judge oursleves by how much service and dedication we have given to others instead of
            how big our own bank account or how high our follower count is.

          <p>
            Instead of stealing your attention and time in order to sell you ads, <strong>Helper</strong>
            wants to change your attitude and get you <em>out of the house</em> and <em>into acts of service</em>
            and every aspect of it pushes towards that goal.
